# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

`![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)`

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

Will generate a `.html` page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate a `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with

```bash
pip install typer markdown
```

or

```bash
uv add typer markdown
```

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustive* which means that it includes everything that you could do on the project included in the
curriculum in this course. Therefore, we do not expect at all that you have checked all boxes at the end of the project.

> how you managed dependencies, the structure of your code and how you managed code quality.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

We used UV for managing our dependencies, because of its increasing relevance in the field. All dependencies are declared in the pyproject.toml file, while exact versions are pinned in a lockfile generated by uv. This lockfile ensures reproducibility across machines and development stages.

To obtain a complete copy of our development environment, a new team member would first install uv and ensure a compatible version of python. After cloning the repository, they would run 'uv sync', which automatically creates a virtual environment and installs all dependencies exactly as specified in the lockfile.


### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
>
> Answer:

We initialized our project using the course-provided Cookiecutter MLOps template, which served as structured starting point for organizing our codebase. From the template, we primarily filled out source directory ('src'), chich containts the core implementation of our project. This folder represents the main workflow of our machine learning pipeline.

The data directory does store contain raw datasets directly in the repository. Instead, raw data is sourced programmatically from kaggle and tracked using DVC. The .dvc directory contains metadata files that refrence versioned data stored externally.

To improve configuration and reproducability, we added a config directory for managing model and pipeline parameters, as well as .devcontainer directory. We also removed the notebooks directory, as our workflow relied on script-based development rather than interactive notebooks. 

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? What about typing and documentation? Additionally,**
> **explain with your own words why these concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for linting and ... for formatting. We also used ... for typing and ... for documentation. These*
> *concepts are important in larger projects because ... . For example, typing ...*
>
> Answer:

Our code is formatted after the official Python style guide, Pep8. We added 'Ruff' as a development dependency to enforce consistent code formating, structure, and linting, healping us maintain clean and readable code. In addition, we sometimes used type hints to improve code reliability and make function inputs and outputs easier to understand. We also included documentaiton and comments where to appropriately clarify the purpose of components.

While good coding practices may seem less important in solo projects, they become essential when dealing with larger projects with multiple contributers. Consistent formatting makes the codebase easier to read, typing helps prevent bugs and misunderstandings, and documentation ensures other developers can quickly understand and expand the project. 

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer: 

In total we have implemented 5 tests, unit tests namely data and model testing as well as integration and performance tests for the backend and frontend of our API. During the data and model tests we ensure the data is properly split, is in the right shape, the distinct models are accurately trained and appear in a structure which is reasonable, further whether our output has the desired shape. For our API we test how its performance is effected under several users by locust, and whether in the backend the model directories can be found as well as prediction is accuractely done, and in the frontend simply whether there is proper connection with the backend.

## Running code and tracking experiments

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
> especially the reproducibility of your experiments.

### Question 12

> **How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would**
> **run a experiment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: Python  my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25*
>
> Answer:

We configured training experiments using Hydra configuration files to separate model, training, and system settings. The config directory contains subfolders for model (e.g. Baseline, Alexnet, VGG16) and training (e.g., default and quick runs), each defining parameters such as architecture, learning rate, batch size, and epochs. A central config.yaml composes these components and specifies data paths, device selection, and output directories. Experiments are executed by selecting configurations at runtime, for example: 
```bash
python src/main_project/train.py model=baseline training=default
```
Hydra also allows for hyperparameters to be overridden from the command line, for example: 
```bash
python src/main_project/train.py training.epochs=20 training.lr=1e-4
```

### Question 13

> **Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information**
> **is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of config files. Whenever an experiment is run the following happens: ... . To reproduce an experiment*
> *one would have to do ...*
>
> Answer:

We ensured experiment reproducibility by combining configuration management, data versioning, and environment control. All experiments are configured using Hydra configuration files, which separate model, training, and system parameters. Whenever an experiment is run, Hydra automatically saves the fully resolved configuration for that run, ensuring that no parameter choices are lost and that each experiment can be tracked back to its exact settings. 

Data reproducibility is handled using DVC. Rather than storing raw data in the repository we track data version through DVC metadata files, allowing experiment to be rerun with the same data version even as datasets evolve. Dependency reproducibility is ensured using uv, Where all python dependencies are declared and pinned in a lockfile committed to version control.

To reproduce and experiment, one would restore the correct data using DVC, synchronize dependencies using uv, and rerun the training script with the same hydroconfiguration. Additionally, a devcontainer/Docker setup ensures a consistent development environment across machines, further reducing sources of variability.

### Question 14

> **Upload 1 to 3 screenshots that show the experiments that you have done in W&B (or another experiment tracking**
> **service of your choice). This may include loss graphs, logged images, hyperparameter sweeps etc. You can take**
> **inspiration from [this figure](figures/wandb.png). Explain what metrics you are tracking and why they are**

>
> Recommended answer length: 200-300 words + 1 to 3 screenshots.
>
> Example:
> *As seen in the first image when have tracked ... and ... which both inform us about ... in our experiments.*
> *As seen in the second image we are also tracking ... and ...*
>
> Answer:

![my_image](figures/WandB_1.png)
![my_image](figures/WandB_2.png)

We used Weights & Biases (W&B) to track and compare our machine learning experiments across different model architectures and training configurations. Each run corresponds to a specific model type allowing us to systematically evaluate perfromance differences. 

As seen in the images above, we have tracked epochs, best validation accuracy, training loss, training accuracy, validation loss, and validation accuracy. Training metrics inform us about how well the model fits the training data, while validation metrics are critical for detecting overfitting and assessing generalization performance. In particular, validation accuracy serves as our primary model selection criterion, as it reflects perfromance on unseen data. we also logged best validaiton accuracy to esily compare the peak perfromance of the best runs. Additionally, we tracked epoch count to align metric across runs and ensure fair compairson when early stopping was triggered 

Furthermore, System metrics were also tracked. These metrics are important from an MLOps perspective, as they provide insight into hardware efficiency, resource consumption, and potential bottlenecks during training. 

By visualizing all metrics in W&B, we were able to compare models such as the baseline, AlexNet, and VGG16 side by side. THis enabled systematic comparison of model behavior and performance across experiments. It should be noted that the reported results do not reflect fully optimized hyperparameters, as the priority focus of this work was on implementing a reproducible and well-intrumented MLOps pipeline rather than maximizing model performance.

### Question 16

> **When running into bugs while trying to run your experiments, how did you perform debugging? Additionally, did you**
> **try to profile your code or do you think it is already perfect?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *Debugging method was dependent on group member. Some just used ... and others used ... . We did a single profiling*
> *run of our main code at some point that showed ...*
>
> Answer:

Debugging method was dependent on group member. In general, when encountering bugs during experiment execution, We first attempted to identify the source of the problem by inserting print statements and inspecting intermediate outputs. For more complex or unclear errors, we made use of AI-assisted tools such as GitHub Copilot to help interpret error messages and suggest potential fixes. This iterative approach allowed us to quickly diagnose configuration issues. 

In addition to debugging, we performed basic profiling of the training loop using Pytorch's built-in ```torch.profiler```. The profiler was used to measure CPU execution time during training, helping us identify potential performance bottlenecks in the data loading and forward/backward passes. Profiling results were exported and visualized using 'ui.perfetto.dev'. While the code is not assumed to be fully optimized, this profiling step provided insight into runtime behavior and profiling implementations.
